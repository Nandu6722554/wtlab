	 <P>Dear Prospective Students,


"Our vision of being a state of the art institution of engineering in pursuit of excellence has come true”

        – endorsed by none other than MHRD/NIRF of the Government of India which ranked CVR among the 101-150 rank group in the country and within top 3 private colleges in Telangana

This is a very special year for the college since we have accomplished our goal of being in the top 3 private engineering colleges in the state. We have come a long way since our humble beginning in 2001 and made this possible within a record time. On behalf of the management I thank our faculty, staff, students, employers, industry partners, alumni, affiliating university (JNTUH) and other stakeholders. I am really excited to inform you that CVR continues to attract the best students and faculty, the key pillars of any premier educational institution. The college has been awarded the National Employability Award for the seventh year in a row, a feat accomplished only by CVR.</P>
